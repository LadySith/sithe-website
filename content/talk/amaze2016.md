abstract = "A talk on how the global game development community helps kick-start game development in non-existent locations and how to get started if you'd like to grow your own game development community. Specifically with the example of Lusaka, Zambia and how the growing community of game developers burgeoned after an amateur attempt at participating in the Global Game Jam 2014. After many more game jams (like GGJ and the Ludum Dare) and events focused on game development, there have been many more game developers discovered in Zambia as well as unexpected people getting introduced to the art."
